<p>This is the final stage. Read carefully, you will have the chance to earn an extra {{Constants.guess_money}}. </p>
<br>

<h5>Did the proposer earn the money?</h5>
<p>Remember there was a two in five chance the proposer had to do the maths task, depending on which ball they randomly drew from the box. If they drew a Task ball, they had to earn the {{Constants.money}} by passing a maths test. If they drew a No-task ball, they were simply gifted the {{Constants.money}}.</p>

<br>
<h5>Which ball did your proposer draw?</h5>
<p>The proposers had to offer either 40% or 10% of the {{Constants.money}} to a receiver, keeping the rest for themselves. They didn't know in advance if the receiver could reject their offer.</p>
<p>You were matched with Proposer {{proposer_id}} who offered you {{offer_percent}}, equal to {{offer_absolute}}. Proposer {{proposer_id}} either drew a Task ball, and did the maths task to earn the money, or drew a No-task ball and was gifted it. Guess which ball they drew. If you guess correctly, you will win {{Constants.guess_money}}. </p>
<br>
<p>Which ball do you think proposer {{proposer_id}} drew?</p>
